variables to remove -
Garage_Area (Garage area encapsulates this info) aggregate(Garage_Area, by=list(Garage_Cars), FUN=mean)
Garage_Cond (highly correlated with Garage_Qual)
BsmtFin_SF_1, Bsmt_Unf_SF, Bsmt_Half_Bath (small correlation with sale price)
Latitude, Longitude (Neighbourhood is better indicator)

Condition 2 (nearly all have same value)
Bsmt_Cond (nearly all values belong to typical: 2616)
Pool_Area (nearly all have same value)
Land_Slope (nearly all have same value)
Bldg_type (nearly all have same value)
Utilities (nearly all have same value)
Roof_Matl (nearly all have same value)

Misc_Val (nearly all zero)

Overall_Cond (same as overall_qual)
