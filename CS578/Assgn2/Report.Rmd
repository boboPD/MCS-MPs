### Question 1

a. Plot of $\log{\alpha}$ vs $\log{\beta}$

```{r}
alpha = rexp(1000, 0.001)
beta = rexp(1000, 0.001)

plot(log(beta), log(alpha))
```

Simulated values of $\theta_1$

```{r}
theta1 = rbeta(1000, alpha, beta)
hist(theta1, freq = F)
```

The histogram is fairly uniform (less informative) as expected since the value of $\lambda$ is close to zero.

b. Alternate setup of the prior

```{r}
phi_1 = runif(1000, 0, 1)
phi_2 = runif(1000, 0, 1000)

alpha_1 = phi_1/phi_2^2
beta_1 = (1-phi_1)/phi_2^2

plot(log(beta_1), log(alpha_1), xlab = "log(beta)", ylab = "log(alpha)")
```


```{r}
theta1_alt = rbeta(1000, alpha, beta)
hist(theta1_alt, freq = F)
```
